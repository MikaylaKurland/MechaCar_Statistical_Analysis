## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](Deliverable1_Residuals.png)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The lowest P values were generated by vehicle_length and ground_clearance. This indicates that they are statistically significant and are correlated to miles per gallon.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Due to the model's extremely low P value (5.35e-11) we see that there is a statistical relationship within the data. This means that we must reject the null hypothesis, and the slope will not be 0.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared value is 0.6825, indicating that this linear model will predict mpg just under 70% of the time. While this isn't foolproof, I would say it's decently effective.
