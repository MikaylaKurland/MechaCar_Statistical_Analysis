## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](Deliverable1_Residuals.png)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The lowest P values were generated by vehicle_length and ground_clearance. This indicates that they are statistically significant and are correlated to miles per gallon.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Due to the model's extremely low P value (5.35e-11) we see that there is a statistical relationship within the data. This means that we must reject the null hypothesis, and the slope will not be 0.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The R-squared value is 0.6825, indicating that this linear model will predict mpg just under 70% of the time. While this isn't foolproof, I would say it's effective. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specificatin for the suspension coils dictates that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The total summary seems to indicate that the variance of all of the coils meets that threshhold, however when we break down the coils and analyze them by lot we see that lot 3's variance is many times higher than that of lot 1 and lot 2, and that lot 3 does *not* meet the specifications of the manufacturer.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The first T-Test run on all of the Manufacturing Lots generated a P value of 0.05734 which shows that there is a statistical relationship. When we analyze this by lot, however, the P values of lots 1 and 2 were much higher than the significance level. This indicates that lot 1 and 2 are not statistically different from the overall population mean of 1500 PSI (see total summary table). Lot 3, however, which we had already flagged as having a high PSI variance, is statistically different than the overall population mean. This can also be seen in the lot summary table above.
